        <p className="pomoinfo-paragraph">
        {"  "}The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method developed by
          Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s. It uses a timer to break work
          into intervals, typically 25 minutes in length, separated by short
          breaks. Each interval is known as a pomodoro, from the Italian word
          for tomato, after the tomato-shaped kitchen timer Cirillo used as a
          university student.

          <li className="pomoinfo-step">

            minutes).

            {" "}
            If you have finished fewer than three pomodoros, go back to Step 2

            After three pomodoros are done, take the fourth pomodoro and then
            take a long break (typically 20 to 30 minutes). Once the long break
            is finished, return to step 2.{" "}

        {"  "}The stages of planning, tracking, recording, processing and
          visualizing are fundamental to the technique. In the planning
          phase, tasks are prioritized by recording them in a "To Do Today"
          list, enabling users to estimate the effort they will require. As
          pomodoros are completed, they are recorded, adding to a sense of
          accomplishment and providing raw data for subsequent self-observation
          and improvement.
